Idea for you to implement
Create a chrome extension that allow me to do two things.
1-click Save all currently opened tabs into  a 'Saved Tab Set'. Allow me to provide my own name. Otherwise choose a name based on the domains of the tabs being saved. Use browser local storage for persistence. 

Show me a list of all saved 'Tab sets'. Upon selecting a tab set, open all the urls in a single chrome window as seperate tabs.
